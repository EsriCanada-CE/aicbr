    "desc": "<h3>About Us</h3><p>The Arctic Institute of Community-Based Research (AICBR) is an independent research organization that works to bring together multiple groups and sectors on issues that are identified by and relevant to our partners. Our current research priorities include food security, healthy lifestyles, chronic disease prevention, injury prevention, and climate change adaptation. We work with northern Indigenous communities, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOâ€™s), governments (Indigenous, Territorial, and Federal), academics, graduate students, research organizations and the private sector. Our research approach prioritizes the principles of community-based research, youth engagement, partnership development, community capacity building, knowledge sharing, inter-sectoral collaboration and evaluation.</p><h3>The AICBR Events Map</h3><p>Every day, there are many different events being held in the various communities across the territories. The AICBR Events Map allows you to filter events by the <b>community</b>, the <b>target group</b>, and the <b>type of event</b> so you only see the events you want to see.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>When you open the AICBR Events Map, you'll automatically see all the events taking place in communities across the territories. Designed for both mobile and desktop devices, event clustering keeps the AICBR Events Map from getting too cluttered at any scale and at any screen size. Simply click on a cluster to break it into smaller clusters or individual events. Colour-coded map markers (<b><span class='orange-text' style='color: rgb(239, 146, 40);'>orange</span></b> for <b>healthy eating</b>; <b><span class='blue-text' style='color: rgb(16, 104, 181);'>blue</span></b> for <b>active living</b>) help you quickly spot the events you are most interested in.</p><p>Click on an <b>event marker</b> to see essential information - what, when, where - about a particular event.  If you are intrigued, click <b>more info</b> to open an expanded popup with event details and contact information.</p><p>If you are using a smartphone or tablet, click the <b><i class='fa fa-bars'></i> menu</b> button in the top-left corner, and you'll see a list of filters to help you narrow down what's displayed on the map to only <b>what/when/where</b> you're interested in.</p><p> Click the <b><i class='fa fa-map-marker'></i> geolocator</b> (underneath the zoom controls) to find exactly where you are on the map, or click the <b><i class='fa fa-search'></i> magnifying glass</b> in the top-right corner to search and zoom to an address on the map.</p>"
